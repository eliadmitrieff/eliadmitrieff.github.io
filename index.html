<h1>Game Of Life on the flattened torus</h1>

<p>The fully local and asynchronous cellular automaton must not wait until all the cells 
are evaluated before starting evaluating the new time frame (so, it does not have timeframes).
It means that the rule must be applied to only one texture. 
Unfortunatelly, WebGL prevents writing to and reading from the same texture to avoid unpredictable results.

<p>
Here a few examples are listed that are still synchronous because they use two copies of the cells:</p>

</ul>
